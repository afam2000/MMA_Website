			Although it is commonly accepted as a form of sport nowadays, there are many people who don't even try to train in a discipline because of misconceptions.
			<br>
			People may find that these activities are too violent, especially when considering kids. 
			<br>
			Martial Arts is actually pretty safe compared to other sports; being struck by a golf-ball will do a lot more damage than being struck by a sparring partner.
			<br>
			The actual forms and technique are not important, although being able to defend oneself is obviously an obvious perk; that is not what Martial Arts is about.
			<br>
			It's much more on a focus of training yourself mentally; the physical aspect is just an added benefit.
			<br>
			It's very beneficial for children to train in self-defense discipline, even at a young age. 
			<br>
			A good teacher will emphasize that violence is always the last resort; solving things peacefully is always preferred.
			<br>
			It's an excellent way to let out some energy in a structured and controlled environment. It has immense benefits both physically and mentally.
